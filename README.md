# Satoru Hara | Architect of Human Natural Structure (HNS)

"Establishing a global standard for AI alignment and governance through the structural synchronization of human cognition, biology, and civilization."

I am the architect of HNS-36, a universal coordinate system (6 Layers x 6 Categories) functioning as a structural OS for humans, AI systems, and civilizational analysis. HNS-36 maps all phenomena to their causal origins, eliminates hallucinations, and provides a unified architecture for the future of intelligence.

## Strategic Integration and Collaboration

The HNS ecosystem (NSW / NAW / KFW) is designed for integration into:

- AI alignment research
- Organizational and institutional architecture
- Human-AI interaction systems
- Global AI governance frameworks

For collaboration, licensing, or integration inquiries, contact via GitHub or official channels.

## Mission

To establish HNS-36 as the global structural standard for:

- AI alignment
- Human-AI interaction
- Organizational architecture
- Civilizational analysis
- International AI governance

Creating a unified OS for the next era of intelligence.
